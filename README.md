#### Segment 1: Triangle Role
##### For our analysis of whether NFL teams will make it to the playoffs or not, we decided to use supervised machine learning.
##### The teams in our data will be classified as being playoff contenders or not, so we have decided to go with a decision tree model.
##### Our mockup, as shown below, contains the steps for a decision tree model. It will take our data (statistics) and run through each one until it the team is classified as playoffs or not. After training and testing our data, we will analyze the confusion matrix to ensure that the accuracy is sufficient for us to move forward with the model as is.
##### Our target accuracy is 70%. If the model does not meet our accuracy needs, then we can test on an updated model.
